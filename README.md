<h1>Pomodoro Timer</h1>

<h2>📋 Summary:</h2> 
<p>
A single page application that is based on the Pomodoro technique of splitting up work sessions with small breaks. Adjust the time you want to spend working and the amount of time you want to break for, then press the play button to start the work interval! Also includes a pause button and a reset button. A alert sound plays at the end of each timed session. An effective way to study, and I use it myself! </p>

<h2>🚧 Obstacles/What I Learned:</h2>
<p>The hardest part of building this timer was the amount of functionality in it. I chose to create a class based component for the timer, and then built the functionality for the rest of the application (changing the length of breaks, etc.) in a separate file using jQuery. Looking back, I think it would have been a better idea to normalize the language I used instead of using two different ones.    </p>
